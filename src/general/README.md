# FlippingBook Public APIs General Information

There are several Public APIs available to your applications. They are all available via our single-host API 
gateway https://api-tc.is.flippingbook.com/.
All APIs require proper [authentication/authorization](/general/authentication) in order to be used. Almost all APIs share 
the same [error reporting convention](/general/error-handling)
